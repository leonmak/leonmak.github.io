<p>I thought of doing a more specific breakdown of the web applications I had contributed to. Hopefully this can also give people (like my juniors) who want to take this module an idea of what to expect, but really the type of ideas are limited by your creativity. There are also some groups who did native for final project, but it’s because they are (really) good at it. I’ll not be covering Assignment 2 as it was an application critique and no building was done. If you’re rreallyy ‘kiasu’ (Singlish for: scared to lose) also check out the <a href="http://cs3216.com/coursework">CS3216 website</a>.</p>
