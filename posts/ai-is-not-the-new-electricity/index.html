<p>This is my change request for the slogan to be: <strong>AI is the new EE</strong>. Maybe less marketable, but at least it fits on a hoodie, if you make AI and EE in big font. &ldquo;AI is the new electricity&rdquo; is kind of a mouthful, and as I will argue inaccurate. I will also attempt to show why phrasing this right is more important than some pedantic pet peeve, as it affects how people look at this emerging industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a CS student, I have often asked myself what to focus on, and how does AI compare to the other new shiny fields? This essay is in part an attempt to answer some of these questions I have been asking myself, which is short for, I&rsquo;m not trolling, just exploring opinions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what is AI? If one flips open their dusty AIMA textbook, we can see there are <a href="http://aima.eecs.berkeley.edu/slides-pdf/chapter01.pdf">4 quadrants</a> for Thinking vs Acting, Rationally vs Humanly.

<p>No matter how you slice and dice it the common word is - Systems</p>

<blockquote>
<h1 id="system">System</h1>

<p>A set of detailed <em>methods</em>, <em>procedures</em> and <em>routines</em> created to carry out a specific activity, perform a duty, or solve a problem</p>

<p>- <em><a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/system.html">http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/system.html</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Electricity is not a system, but I believe the motivation for associating electricity to AI is that at the end of the day their net economic <strong>effects</strong> are the same. Those effects are much discussed elsewhere. For the sake of brevity they are, in a sentence: increased automation, lowered production costs, increasing long term productivity, all that good stuff from econs, which also tells us poignantly that low wage jobs like some factory jobs will be lost.</p>

<p>But why conflate the effects and the processes of AI? It is the products of AI that are like electricity. AI/ML techniques are like <strong>generators</strong>, they <em>convert</em> raw data into a more useable resource, like predictions. The product is a <strong>percentage</strong> point (representing a prediction, classification, decision), which is a closer analogy to <strong>electricity</strong>, the only juice that my electronic drill needs, the only floating point value that an ad network needs to know to decide whether or not to send that ad to you.</p>

<p>AI/ML techniques <strong>transforms</strong> data into more usable forms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to <em>meaningfully transform data</em>: in other words, to learn useful <em>representations</em> of the input data at hand—representations that get us closer to the expected output &hellip; what’s a representation? At its core, it’s a different way to look at data — to <em>represent</em> or <em>encode</em> data.</p>

<p>- <em>Deep Learning with Python, François Chollet</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>An alternative slogan could be: <strong>AI is the new transformer</strong>, which isn&rsquo;t much more of a metaphor, but with confusing connotations it would at least prompt some thinking along those lines, although it leans more to the marketing side of the aforementioned accuracy-marketing tradeoff. Read the table below from left to right, AI is that one step before output, but all too often is lumped together with the rest of the columns.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th>Processed by</th>
<th>Output</th>
<th>Application</th>
<th>Net Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Data (Audio, Video, Images, Text, etc.)</td>
<td><strong>AI/ML</strong>, Deep Learning</td>
<td>Prediction, Classification, Action</td>
<td>Ad network, Robot housekeepr</td>
<td>Serve Ad, Clean room</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Raw Material (Oil, Gas, Light, Waves, etc.)</td>
<td>Generator / Engine, Turbine</td>
<td>Electricity</td>
<td>Electric Drill, Dishwasher</td>
<td>Hole in wall, Clean dishes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Jumping the gun and thinking of AI in terms of its <strong>Applications &amp; Net Effect</strong> (i.e. Products to sell) and not as a <strong>Process</strong> of Transforming data (i.e. as Generators) seems natural. By talking about AI and the end game in the same vein we necessarily associate the two. Perhaps there is no easy way to get around this, I mean I don&rsquo;t even talk about electrical generators (unless one is going outfield into the jungle), now I just want to know if I have WIFI to type this thing. Maybe there are ways to dissociate this line of thinking, this essay is an attempt at such. Learning about AI/ML in school where one needs to write code (even if one doesn&rsquo;t get the best grades) is, I think, the surest way to give people a concrete sense of how AI is affecting their lives in practice, which I guess is my roundabout way of hoping for more AI/ML courses to be publicly available.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A final point. Words are like mental models attempting to approximate real meaning, even truth. I have put forward 2 alternatives I think have &ldquo;better fit&rdquo; than &ldquo;electricity&rdquo;, but hey, I may be wrong, it may even fall under the &ldquo;True But Useless&rdquo; category, we&rsquo;ll only know after the testing.</p>
