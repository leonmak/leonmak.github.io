<p>Maybe a less marketable slogan would be <strong>AI is the new EE</strong>. EE majors would be needed to construct non-von Neumann architecture-type computers, and at least it would fit on a hoodie. &ldquo;AI is the new electricity&rdquo; is a mouthful, and perhaps somewhat inaccurate. Phrasing it right is more important than some pedantic pet peeve, as it affects how people look at the emerging industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a CS student, I have often asked myself what to focus on, and how does AI compare to the other new shiny fields? This essay is in part an attempt to answer some of these questions I have been asking myself, which is short for, I&rsquo;m not trolling, just exploring opinions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is AI again? If one flips open their dusty AIMA textbook, we can see there are <a href="http://aima.eecs.berkeley.edu/slides-pdf/chapter01.pdf">4 quadrants</a> for Thinking vs Acting, Rationally vs Humanly.

<p>No matter how you slice and dice it the common word is - Systems</p>

<blockquote>
<h1 id="system">System</h1>

<p>A set of detailed <em>methods</em>, <em>procedures</em> and <em>routines</em> created to carry out a specific activity, perform a duty, or solve a problem</p>

<p>- <em><a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/system.html">http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/system.html</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Electricity is not a system, but I believe the motivation for associating electricity to AI is that at the end of the day their net economic <strong>effects</strong> are the same. Those effects are much discussed elsewhere. For the sake of brevity they are, in a sentence: increased automation, lowered production costs, increasing long term productivity, all that good stuff from econs, which also tells us poignantly that low wage factory-type jobs will be lost.</p>

<p>But why conflate the effects and the processes of AI? It is the products, not the process of AI that are like electricity. AI/ML techniques are like <strong>generators</strong>, they <em>convert</em> raw data into a more useable resource, like predictions, by statistical interpretations. The product is something that was <em>assigned</em> a meaning, a <strong>percentage</strong> point (representing a prediction, classification, decision). Since the processed data is the key raw material for end-users, it is a closer analogy to <strong>electricity</strong>, like the only juice that my electronic appliance needs, the end product is the only decimal point value that an ad network needs to have, to decide whether or not to send that ad to you.</p>

<p>AI/ML techniques <strong>transforms</strong> data into more usable forms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to <em>meaningfully transform data</em>: in other words, to learn useful <em>representations</em> of the input data at hand—representations that get us closer to the expected output &hellip; what’s a representation? At its core, it’s a different way to look at data — to <em>represent</em> or <em>encode</em> data.</p>

<p>- <em>Deep Learning with Python, François Chollet</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>An alternative slogan could be: <strong>AI is the new transformer</strong>, which isn&rsquo;t much more of a metaphor, but at least the confusing images of general AI and corny movie soundtracks it invokes in the mind would prompt some thinking along what AI is. As the table below shows from left to right, AI is that one step before output, and possibly in a few years the step after, but all too often is lumped together with the rest of the columns.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th>Processed by</th>
<th>Output</th>
<th>Application</th>
<th>Net Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Data (Audio, Video, Images, Text, etc.)</td>
<td><strong>AI/ML</strong>, Deep Learning</td>
<td>Statistics - (Prediction, Classification, Confidence)</td>
<td><strong>(AI-enabled)</strong> Ad network, Robot housekeeper</td>
<td>Serve Ad, Clean room</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Raw Material (Oil, Gas, Light, Waves, etc.)</td>
<td>Generator / Engine, Turbine</td>
<td><strong>Electricity</strong></td>
<td>Electric Drill, Dishwasher</td>
<td>Hole in wall, Clean dishes</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>MNCs (Big 4+)</td>
<td></td>
<td>MNCs + Startups</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>So <strong>AI is still electricity</strong>, just like electricity transforms oil into holes into the wall, in the broadest forms it is input as raw materials and the automation of mundane actions and decisions as the net output. By skipping all the middlemen processes, we too replace even more of the repetitive decision processes, and other things that get in the way of life. Processes and basic research are undertaken by big comapnies like Google, the army, and other organizations which have enough funding, just like Boeing and other MNCs build engines. Startups, or the MNCs which fund them, tend to work on the application side, applying new found mathematical secrets to improve lives.</p>

<p><em>An aside: An interesting point to note is that in terms of a sort of accuracy-marketing tradeoff, on the left with AI/ML research generally being about scientific accuracy marketing seems to take a back seat, but on the right with applications of AI, it seems accuracy is less a priority than sales and marketing. What is the net effect? More students lower R&amp;D costs, but will it be the case of over-sell and under-deliver? How many mundane tasks are real pain points blocking breakthroughs? Only time will tell. I also think some neglected areas would be at the ends, the input and net effect. The generation of new and more useful data (like medical research data), would help the feedback loop of not just making better AI but real physical improvements instead of trying to milking large existing datasets like social media for nebulous insights. Countries like China which do much manufacturing would probably gain more from AI in my opinion.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.</p>

<p>- Phil Karlton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A final point. I think words are like &ldquo;mini-models&rdquo; we use to explain, predict, and as humans, influence our society. I like the above quote because it has more depth than it appears to, although people talk about variable naming and boring things like that, when applying it to things people say about computer science itself reflects the more human implications of the science.</p>
